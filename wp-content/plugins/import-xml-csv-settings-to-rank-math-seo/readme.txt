Easily import SEO settings from any XML or CSV file to WordPress SEO Plugin – Rank Math with the Rank Math Add-On for WP All Import.

== Description ==

The Rank Math Add-On for [WP All Import](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import "WordPress XML & CSV Import") makes it easy to bulk import your SEO setting to the WordPress SEO Plugin – Rank Math plugin in less than 10 minutes.

The left side shows all of the fields that you can import to and the right side displays the data from your XML/CSV file. Then you can simply drag & drop the data from your XML or CSV into the WordPress SEO Plugin – Rank Math fields to import them.

The importer is so intuitive it is almost like manually configuring Rank Math when adding/editing a post.

It's easy to begin with our [Quickstart Guide](https://www.wpallimport.com/documentation/getting-started/importing-an-xml-or-csv-file/).

= Why you should use the Rank Math Add-On for WP All Import =

* Import new posts, pages, or custom post types and configure their SEO settings all in the same import.

* Update SEO settings for existing posts, pages, or custom post types already published on your site with [Bulk Edit](https://www.wpallimport.com/bulk-edit-wordpress-data/).

* Compatible with all other [WP All Import add-ons](https://www.wpallimport.com/add-ons/).

* Complete support - configure all available SEO settings for your posts, including social media images.

= WP All Import Professional Edition =

The Rank Math Add-On for WP All Import is fully compatible with [the free version of WP All Import](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import "WordPress XML & CSV Import"). 

However, [the professional edition of WP All Import](https://www.wpallimport.com/pricing/?utm_source=free-plugin&utm_medium=dot-org&utm_campaign=rankmath-seo) includes premium support and adds the following features:

* Import files from a URL: Download and import files from external websites, even if they are password protected with HTTP authentication. 

* Cron Job/Recurring Imports: WP All Import Pro can periodically check a file for updates then add, edit, delete, and update your posts.

* Custom PHP Functions: Pass your data through custom functions by using [my_function({data[1]})] in your import template. WP All Import will pass the value of {data[1]} through my_function and use whatever it returns.

* Access to premium technical support.
